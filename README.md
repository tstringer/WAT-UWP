Web App Template (WAT) for Universal Windows Platform (UWP)
=========================

Web App Template (WAT) is Visual Studio 2015 project that lets developers create Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps based on existing web content. 

Used in the right way, WAT can facilitate the creation of compelling extensions to your web content for Windows users.

## What's new

### Cortana

Template automatically pulls in all items from all navbar, appbar, settings and search items. You can toggle this feature for any or all in the configuration file.

 - For items in navbar, appbar and settings; you can use "AppName Go [to] ItemName" to navigate 
 - For search; you can use "AppName Search [for] SearchTerm" to search

### In-app Voice Commands

Similar to Cortana, but only pulls in all navbar commands, and search. You can toggle this feature in the configuration file.
 - Home will navigate to home URL.
 - Back will navigate to the last page.
 - Search will popup a new dialog box that accepts user voice input for any search terms.
 - Any other navigation command will navigate to it's predefined url.

### Inking
Enables user to ink and share inking to any share target app.
You can toggle this feature via the "wat_ink" toggle in the configuration file.
If you don't have header enabled, you can not use the inking since there won't be a button to toggle it.
